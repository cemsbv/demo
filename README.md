# CEMS BV Jupyter Lite NoteBooks

[![lite-badge](https://jupyterlite.rtfd.io/en/latest/_static/badge.svg)](https://cemsbv.github.io/demo/)

JupyterLite deployed as a static site to GitHub Pages, for demo purposes.

## Troubleshooting

Try to start JupyterLite in an incognito window to avoid interfering
with our old session storage.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- What is JupyterLite?

[JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/) is a JupyterLab distribution that runs entirely in the browser
built from the ground-up using JupyterLab components and extensions.

- Do I lose my progress when I close the tab?

By default, [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/configure/storage.html) uses the userâ€™s
browser storage to store settings and site preferences. This means that generally your files are saved as long as you
don't clear the browsers' storage. Nonetheless, its good practise to save your file locally when you're done.

## Format

We format our code with black and isort.

```bash
black --config "pyproject.toml" content
isort --settings-path "pyproject.toml" content
```

## Requirements

JupyterLite is being tested against modern web browsers:

- Firefox 90+
- Chromium 89+

Requirements are autogenerated by `pip-compile` with python 3.9

```bash
pip-compile --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.ini
```

To update the requirements within the defined ranges, run:

```bash
pip-compile --upgrade  --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.ini
```

## Deploy JupyterLite locally

Build and deploy JupyterLite locally:

```bash
python -m pip install jupyterlite-core

jupyter lite build --output-dir dist

jupyter lite serve --lite-dir dist --contents content
```
